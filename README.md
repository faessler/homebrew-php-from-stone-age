# PHP from stone age
Do you have a legacy app which is running on an outdated php version and now you want to install this old php version via homebrew?
Then you're at the right place. Simply tap this repo and you can install the php versions ~~5.3, 5.4,~~ 5.5 and 5.6 like the newer versions.

## Tap the repo
`brew tap faessler/php-from-stone-age`

## Install the old PHP version as required
~~`brew install php@5.3`~~
~~`brew install php@5.4`~~
`brew install php@5.5`
`brew install php@5.6`

~~## Older version than 5.3
If you have an older version than 5.3 (I'm very sorry for you btw), then make an issue and I'll try to add it to this repo.~~

PHP 5.3 & 5.4 under construction.
